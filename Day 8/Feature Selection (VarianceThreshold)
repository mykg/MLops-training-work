Feature Selection (Variance Threshold)

Like take an example we have college dataset of students in which college id will remain same for all 
but suppose we have another college dataset in it
We actually don't need this college id as it doesn't predict anything so to remove it or not to include it in Feature selection we use VarianceThreashold


from sklearn.feature_selection import VarianceThreshold
model_t = VarianceThreshold(threshold=0.3)  threshold values changes as if there are 30% value changes in college id column we signifies it as 0.3 we value don't change as all throught the column then we put 0.0
then we
model_t.fit(dataset) whatever dataset we have
model_t.get_support() to check the we eliminated that feature or we didn't invloved it
